    <h3>The dangers that the island face</h3>
    <h4>On September 26, 2007, a report was published that the island of Qaruh could be submerged due to pollution, as the island was surrounded by coral belts, but these belts began to break because of the boats mooring next to them, causing strong waves to reach the island that did not rise from the ground significantly. In 1997, the Director of the Environmental Sciences Department at the Scientific Research Institute Dr. Al-Ghadban said that there are two reasons that may lead to the disappearance of the island, the first is the disappearance of coral reefs and the second is the rise in sea levels. The change in the direction of the waves during the seasons of the year led to a very rapid reduction in the size of the island, so a marine pier was created that limits the waves and saves the island from the smallness of its land area and added many marine anchors around the island to moor boats to protect the coral reefs surrounding the island. Was done the island was declared a natural reserve in 2008, and the laws to protect wildlife have not been implemented on its soil yet.</h4>
