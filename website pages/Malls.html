    <h3>Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Cultural Center (opera house)</h3>
    <h4>The Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Centre (JACC), informally known as the Kuwait Opera House, is a prominent cultural center in Kuwait, located on the Gulf Road in the capital Kuwait City. It is the largest cultural center and opera house in the Middle East. The cultural centre is part of the new Kuwait National Cultural District</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <h4>The cultural centre contains four buildings, which are organized around entrance courtyards off a civic plaza. They sit like "Jewels" in a larger public park setting. This enriches the built environment.</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>The design was inspired by Islamic architectural tradition. These are two dimensional patterns, which are transformed three dimensionally to create spaces below a complex geometric form. The buildings sit independently below the "jewel" which houses the functional requirements of the building.</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Dramatic public spaces are created between the two forms using the contrast of light and shadow. Local culture is reinterpreted within the buildings by using technology to deliver complexity with simplicity. The pattern is created to accommodate the cultural need for privacy, views and shading.</h4>
